# 🛡️ Clampify – Rugproof Meme Token Launchpad  
**A Secure, Gasless, Community-Governed Platform to Launch Sustainable Meme Tokens**  

![cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feb5234d-5ac2-42b1-a8b3-94897d1ccf61)

## 🚨 The Problem

The meme token space is exploding — but it's broken:

- **$4.7B+** lost to **rug pulls** and exit scams since 2022 (CertiK)
- **96%** of meme tokens launched in 2024 had **no anti-dump protections**
- Projects often rely on **centralized creators**, vulnerable liquidity, and **no safeguards**
- **Whale dumps**, bot attacks, and unsafe tokenomics destroy community trust
- No existing platform offers **true security, decentralization, or gasless UX**

The result?  
**A high-risk space dominated by short-term gains and long-term losses.**

## ✅ The Clampify Solution

**Clampify** is a meme token launch platform that makes **rug pulls mathematically impossible** and **protects investors by design.**

We do this through:

🔐 **Protocol-Enforced Supply Locking**  
🛡️ **Anti-Rug Pull Safeguards**  
🧠 **AI-Powered Risk Detection**  
🧾 **Transparent On-Chain Tokenomics**  
⚡ **Gasless Token Creation via Account Abstraction**  
🗳️ **Built-in Governance Tools**

Clampify turns meme tokens from risky experiments into **secure, community-owned assets**.

## 🧠 Why Clampify is Different

| Feature                     | Clampify ✅ | Pump.fun ❌ | PinkSale ⚠️ | Standard DEX ❌ |
|----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Supply Locking Mechanism   | ✅ Advanced time-based | ❌ No | ⚠️ Basic | ❌ Not available |
| Anti-Rug Pull Safeguards   | ✅ Protocol-enforced | ❌ No | ⚠️ Basic locks | ❌ No |
| Gradual Unlock Schedules   | ✅ Linear, milestone, cliff | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Whale & Bot Protection     | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No |
| Gasless Token Creation     | ✅ Paymaster + AA | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| On-Chain Governance        | ✅ Built-in | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| AI-Powered Risk Detection  | ✅ SecretLLM Scoring | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

Clampify is the **first truly rugproof launchpad** that puts **community and transparency first.**

## 🎯 Bounties We're Targeting

### 🛠️ T1 – Best Use of `𝚝𝟷` ($2,500)
- We use T1 Protocol to enforce secure meme token launches by handling permissionless token creation and smart constraints for supply locking, anti-rug rules, and unlock schedules. It powers the core logic behind Clampify's rugproof protocol.

### 🗄️ 0G – Storage ($1,200)
- Store launch metadata, token lock configurations, audit logs
- Build **off-chain verifiable** transparency layer for token history

### 🏆 Privy – Agentic Consumer ($1,000)
- Integrate Privy for **seamless identity abstraction**
- Protect user data while allowing **secure token interaction**


### 🙈 Nillion – Best Use of SecretLLM ($2,500)
- We have used Nillion's Completions API and generated the JWT token by connecting the wallet. We have used Langchain to handle that API. I have created the custom Langchain LLM handler module for Nillion in Python. The backend server is running, and the data will be sent to the frontend.
