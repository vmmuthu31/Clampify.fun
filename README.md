# 🛡️ Clampify – Rugproof Meme Token Launchpad  
**A Secure, Gasless, Community-Governed Platform to Launch Sustainable Meme Tokens**  

![cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feb5234d-5ac2-42b1-a8b3-94897d1ccf61)

## 🚨 The Problem

The meme token space is exploding — but it's broken:

- **$4.7B+** lost to **rug pulls** and exit scams since 2022 (CertiK)
- **96%** of meme tokens launched in 2024 had **no anti-dump protections**
- Projects often rely on **centralized creators**, vulnerable liquidity, and **no safeguards**
- **Whale dumps**, bot attacks, and unsafe tokenomics destroy community trust
- No existing platform offers **true security, decentralization, or gasless UX**

The result?  
**A high-risk space dominated by short-term gains and long-term losses.**
