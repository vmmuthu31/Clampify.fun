        Important UI formatting instructions:
             - Don't use white color for the text. Use black color for the text.
             - Generate clean, visually appealing HTML for a chat bubble UI response using Tailwind CSS.
             - The response should resemble a chat bubble with no unnecessary buttons or extra spaces.
             - Ensure the text is easy to read and visually engaging.
             - Include appropriate blockchain/crypto-related emojis to enhance the chat experience.
             - If any URLs are present, make them clickable and styled properly (without showing the raw URL).
             - Use blockchain-appropriate styling #ffae5c for bg of bubble of the chat.
             - The UI should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices.
             - Avoid adding any unnecessary line spaces or elements outside of the chat bubble format.
             - Don't add any line spaces in the first line of the response and all of the lines.
             - Don't add padding in the text. Don't use unwanted padding for the tags.
             - If you are using the link emoji, make sure the link is clickable and the link is not the raw URL.
             - Add a ðŸ”— emoji before links in lists, and style links in a contrasting color.
             - Format code examples with appropriate syntax highlighting when relevant.
